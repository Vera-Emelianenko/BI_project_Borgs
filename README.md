## Materials and methods

### Data 

Genome sequences of Borgs and their annotated proteins were downloaded from https://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/BMp/organisms after registering on the databse website. 

### Analysing core genes

Orthologous genes were identified in all complete and near-complete Borgs with proteinortho 6.0.33, with the default parameters. The resulting table (`data/borgs.proteinortho.tsv`) was then filtered to contain only orthogroups present in 12 or more genomes, and these proteins were extracted from the fasta files using custom python scripts. Each orthogroup was aligned with MUSCLE v3.8.1551 with the default parameters (`data/alignments/group_0-75.afa.zip`). Only the alignments with > 60% identity were analysed.  

### Functional analysis of cluster proteins 

Cluster proteins were extracted with custom python scripts using the ncbi id and coordinates in identified clusters, and the obtained fasta file was annotated using the web-version of eggNOG-mapper (http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de/) (`data/cluster_proteins.emapper.annotations.tsv`).
