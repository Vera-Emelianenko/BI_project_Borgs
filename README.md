## Introduction



## Goal and objectives 

## Workflow



## Materials and methods

### Data 

Genome sequences of Borgs and their annotated proteins were downloaded from https://ggkbase.berkeley.edu/BMp/organisms after registering on the databse website. 

### Analysing core genes

Orthologous genes were identified in all complete and near-complete Borgs with proteinortho 6.0.33, with the default parameters. The proteins from the resulting table (`data/borgs.proteinortho.tsv`) were extracted from the fasta file using custom python scripts, and each orthogroup was aligned with MUSCLE v3.8.1551 with the default parameters (`data/alignments/group_0-75.afa.zip`). 

### Functional analysis of cluster proteins 

### KEGG enrichment
